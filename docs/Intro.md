# Crysol Documentation

## What are `vmed` functions?

Traditionally, Solidity has been primarily used for verifying cryptographic objects and rarely for creating them, eg we
verify ECDSA signatures in Solidity via `ecrecover` and create them via our non-Solidity based wallet libraries.

`crysol` takes a more comprehensive approach and also provides functionality to create cryptographic objects, allowing developers to test and experiment with cryptographic systems from within their Solidity environment.

However, most Solidity code is run on public blockchains - the last place one should perform operations requiring a private key as input.

To ensure operations using sensitive data are never run on non-local blockchains such functions are "`vmed`", meaning they revert whenever the blockchain's chain id is not `31337`.


## The Prelude

Many libraries include a code block called _prelude_ providing common internal functionality.
It provides the `vmed` modifier which protects certain functions from being called in non-local environments.

The _prelude_ code is:

```solidity
// ~~~~~~~ Prelude ~~~~~~~
// forgefmt: disable-start
Vm private constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint(keccak256("hevm cheat code")))));
modifier vmed() {
    if (block.chainid != 31337) revert("requireVm");
    _;
}
// forgefmt: disable-end
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

## TODO: Signature Rules

- Malleable signatures are deemed invalid
    - For ECDSA malleable signature if `s > Q/2` which is in sync with ecosystem
- Only 32 byte digests are signed, never byte strings
    - It is always assumed that the digest is a keccak256 hash digest
- The default `sign` function MUST only sign domain separated messages
    - For ECDSA using "Ethereum Signed Message" as defined via `eth_sign`
    - For Schnorr its part of ERC-XXX
- There are `signRaw` functions that MUST NOT domain separate user input digests
    - Usage is discouraged
- User input is called `digest`, which is domain separated to message `m`, wich is signed

- Terminology:
    - A user wants to sign byte string `message`
    - The `message` is hashed via keccak256 to `digest`
    - The `digest` is domain separated to `m`

## TODO: Sanity Check Rules

- De/Serialization functions MUST revert if object is invalid/insane
    - Example: It MUST NOT be possible to serialize an invalid public key
    - Example: It MUST NOT be possible to deserialize a malleable ECDSA signature
- Type conversion functions MUST NOT revert if object is invalid/insane
    - Example: It MUST be possible to transform an invalid public key to an point
    - Example: It MUST be possible to transform an insance Schnorr signature to a compressed Schnorr signature
